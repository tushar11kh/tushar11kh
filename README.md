## 🤖 Development Approach (AI Tools)  

I actively use **AI tools** to accelerate development and learning:  

- 💻 **ChatGPT & DeepSeek** → pair-programming, code generation, refactoring.  
- 📚 **Perplexity** → for researching technologies I know less about and quickly understanding new concepts.  
- 🔒 Focus: **security, reliability, and clean architecture**. I use AI to handle boilerplate and speed up delivery, while I carefully **review, test, and optimize** the final implementation.  
- 🚀 I treat AI as a **productivity multiplier**, not a replacement — I define system design, ensure best practices, and make final technical decisions.

## 🌍 Learning Philosophy  

I believe every programming language has its own **unique strengths**:  
- 🧹 **Java, Go** → garbage collectors simplify memory management.  
- ⚡ **Go** → excels at concurrency with goroutines and channels.  
- 🔐 **Rust** → ensures memory safety without a garbage collector.  
- 🐍 **Python** → great for rapid prototyping and ecosystem richness.  
- ☕ **Java / C#** → strong object-oriented ecosystems for enterprise software.  

At the same time, **all languages share common foundations**:  
👉 data types, conditionals (`if/else`), loops, functions, data structures, error handling, file I/O, etc.  
The syntax changes, but the **principles remain the same**.  

⚡ Since technology evolves quickly and frameworks can become obsolete, my focus in this AI-driven world is:  
- Learning **frameworks** to build faster.  
- Understanding **how things work under the hood** (systems, infra, compilers, protocols).  
- Knowing **what is required to make things work**, not memorizing every detail of a language.
