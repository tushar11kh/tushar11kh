## Development Approach (AI Tools)  

I actively use **AI tools** to accelerate development and learning:  

- **ChatGPT & DeepSeek** â†’ pair-programming, code generation, refactoring.  
- **Perplexity** â†’ for researching technologies I know less about and quickly understanding new concepts.  
- Focus: **security, reliability, and clean architecture**. I use AI to handle boilerplate and speed up delivery, while I carefully **review, test, and optimize** the final implementation.  
- I treat AI as a **productivity multiplier**, not a replacement â€” I define system design, ensure best practices, and make final technical decisions.

## Learning Philosophy  

I believe every programming language has its own **unique strengths**:  
- **Java, Go** â†’ garbage collectors simplify memory management.  
- **Go** â†’ excels at concurrency with goroutines and channels.  
- **Rust** â†’ ensures memory safety without a garbage collector.  
- **Python** â†’ great for rapid prototyping and ecosystem richness.  
- **Java / C#** â†’ strong object-oriented ecosystems for enterprise software.  

At the same time, **all languages share common foundations**:  
data types, conditionals (`if/else`), loops, functions, data structures, error handling, file I/O, etc.  
The syntax changes, but the **principles remain the same**.  

Since technology evolves quickly and frameworks can become obsolete, my focus in this AI-driven world is:  
- Learning **frameworks** to build faster.  
- Understanding **how things work under the hood** (systems, infra, compilers, protocols).  
- Knowing **what is required to make things work**, not memorizing every detail of a language.
